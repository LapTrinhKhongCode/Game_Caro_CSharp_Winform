# Game Caro CSharp Winform: 

Caro, or Gomoku, is a strategy board game where two players take turns placing X and O on a grid, aiming to align five in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Popular in Vietnam and Japan, it combines simplicity with strategic depth, making it enjoyable for all ages.

The winner is decided when there are 5 vertical, horizontal or diagonal cells containing consecutive characters(X or O).

I use the STACK data structure to implement the "UNDO" feature to help users undo the move they made wrong.
